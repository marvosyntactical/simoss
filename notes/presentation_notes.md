# Talk Notes and Questions


### Monte Carlo Integration

##### Notes

* num int used when antiderivative cannot be found
* when closed form not known
* error of order (n^{-p-1})
*
*
*

##### Questions

* why is error 1/(n^-p+1)
* reference [Spi08] ... where is it?
* does simpson's rule contain a condition for f1'(xmiddle) = f2'(xmiddle)
* higher dimensional error N^{-r/d} ... what is r?
* what is the runtime of monte carlo integration? expect longer than numerical rules because higher n is probably needed?
* what if xn isnt sampled but set to xi-1 + width
* in error graph, does the spike have a meaning?
* what is the technique of generating an x and seeing if x <= f(x1) called?
* what is the computational complexity of the numerical rules? since number of evaluations is much lower i would expect much shorter runtime?



### Continuous Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo SIR Infection Model

* what is assumed independent?
* state space is smaller than {0,...,N}^3, no?
